# SM4 SBOX
This is a verilog implementation of SM4 S-box based on the paper of The logic design of SM4 S-box in hardware based on asymmetric matrix expansion and sub-module series connection

- sbox.v is the verilog code provided in this paper;
- sbox_ref.v is a reference.
- tb_sbox.v is a simple testbench to verify the implementation.


# SM4 SBOX TEST
In order to realize the performance test of the designed S-box, implementation of high-speed SM4 encryption and decryption on FPGA.
